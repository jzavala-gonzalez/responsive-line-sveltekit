# Responsive Line Chart (in ✨Svelte✨)

The original React component was created by Sam Selikoff at Build UI. It's a great writeup and code that can be found [here](https://buildui.com/recipes/responsive-line-chart).

Follow up could be experimenting with applying this technique in Observable's Plot library or how to incorporate AM4 data reduction if necessary.
